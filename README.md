# Campus Event Management System

## 🎯 Project Overview

Welcome to the Campus Event Management System - a modern, cloud-native web application designed to revolutionize how students discover and engage with campus events. What makes this project special isn't just the application itself, but the sophisticated DevOps pipeline that powers it. Imagine pushing your code changes to GitHub and having them automatically deployed to a production-ready AWS infrastructure within minutes - no manual intervention, no complex deployment scripts, just pure automation magic.

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of modern cloud-native development practices, showcasing how enterprise-grade infrastructure can be managed entirely through code. When you commit changes to the main branch, an orchestrated chain of events begins: GitHub Actions springs into action, provisioning all necessary AWS resources if they don't exist, building optimized Docker containers for both frontend and backend, pushing them to Amazon's Elastic Container Registry, and finally deploying them to ECS Fargate clusters behind a load balancer. The entire journey from code commit to live production takes approximately 5-7 minutes max, resulting in a highly available, scalable application that's ready to handle real-world traffic.

## 🎯 What This Application Does

At its core, this is a full-featured event management platform tailored for university campuses. Students can seamlessly browse through a curated list of upcoming events, each with detailed information including descriptions, dates, locations, and available spots. The application provides an intuitive filtering system allowing users to narrow down events by categories such as Workshops, Hackathons, Tech Talks, Career Fairs, and Study Groups.

The registration system, while simulated using browser's local storage for demonstration purposes, showcases production-ready UI patterns including:

- **Real-time feedback** with loading states during operations
- **Instant updates** showing current registration counts
- **Optimistic UI updates** for smooth user experience
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks and retry mechanisms
- **State persistence** across browser sessions

The frontend is built with React 18 and styled beautifully with Tailwind CSS, offering a responsive design that works flawlessly across desktop and mobile devices. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express, provides robust REST API endpoints with proper CORS configuration, health check endpoints for container orchestration, and structured logging for debugging and monitoring.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Here's everything you need to do to have a production-ready application running on AWS infrastructure in under 15 minutes:

### Prerequisites
- **An AWS Account** with appropriate permissions (you'll need access to create ECS, VPC, ALB, ECR, and IAM resources)
- **GitHub Account** for hosting your repository
- **AWS Access Keys** (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) with programmatic access

### Deployment Steps

**1. Clone and Prepare Your Repository**
```bash
git clone <this-repository-url>
cd End-to-End-Deployment-Automation-to-AWS-using-GitHub-Actions
```

**2. Create Your Own GitHub Repository**

Push this code to your own GitHub repository where you have administrative access to manage secrets.

**3. Configure AWS Credentials in GitHub Secrets**

Navigate to your GitHub repository settings, then to "Secrets and variables" → "Actions", and add the following secrets:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Your AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Your AWS secret key

**4. Trigger the Deployment**

Simply push any change to the main branch, or manually trigger the workflow:
```bash
git push origin main
```

That's genuinely all there is to it! GitHub Actions will orchestrate the entire deployment process automatically. You can monitor the progress in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository, where you'll see detailed logs of every step - from infrastructure provisioning to Docker image building, and finally the ECS service deployment.

### 🧹 Cleanup Resources

When you're done experimenting or need to delete all created AWS resources to avoid ongoing charges, you can do using GitHub Actions Workflow**
```bash
gh workflow run cleanup.yml
```

This requires the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to be installed and authenticated.

Both methods will systematically delete all created AWS resources including ECS services, clusters, load balancers, target groups, VPC components, security groups, ECR repositories (and all images), CloudWatch log groups, and IAM roles. The process typically completes in 3-5 minutes and leaves your AWS account clean.

## ⚙️ How the Deployment Pipeline Works

The beauty of this project lies in its sophisticated yet fully automated deployment pipeline. Every component works in harmony to deliver a seamless experience from code commit to production deployment. Here's the fascinating journey your code takes:

### Infrastructure Provisioning (First Deployment Only)

During the initial deployment, the GitHub Actions workflow intelligently checks for existing infrastructure. If none is found, it automatically provisions a complete, production-ready AWS environment:

- **VPC Setup**: Creates a Virtual Private Cloud with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, providing isolated network space
- **Network Architecture**: Configures two public subnets across different availability zones for high availability
- **Internet Connectivity**: Sets up an Internet Gateway and route tables enabling outbound internet access
- **Security Groups**: Establishes three distinct security groups with least-privilege access patterns:
  - ALB security group (allows HTTP traffic from anywhere)
  - Backend security group (allows traffic only from ALB on port 3000)
  - Frontend security group (allows traffic only from ALB on port 80)
- **Load Balancer**: Deploys an Application Load Balancer with health checks and target groups for both services
- **Container Registry**: Creates ECR repositories for storing Docker images
- **Logging Infrastructure**: Sets up CloudWatch log groups for centralized logging
- **IAM Roles**: Configures necessary execution roles with appropriate permissions

### Continuous Deployment Workflow (Every Push)

Once infrastructure exists, every subsequent push to the main branch triggers an optimized deployment:

1. **Source Checkout**: GitHub Actions checks out your latest code
2. **AWS Authentication**: Securely authenticates using your stored credentials
3. **Docker Build Process**: 
   - Multi-stage builds optimize image sizes
   - Frontend builds static assets with Vite before packaging with Nginx
   - Backend bundles Node.js application with all dependencies
4. **Image Registry**: Pushes tagged Docker images to ECR repositories
5. **Task Definition Updates**: Registers new ECS task definitions with latest image URIs
6. **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: 
   - ECS services are updated with force-new-deployment flag
   - Old tasks continue serving traffic during new task startup
   - Load balancer health checks ensure new tasks are ready
   - Only then does traffic shift to new containers
7. **Health Verification**: Waits for services to reach stable state with all tasks running
8. **URL Output**: Provides the live application URLs in the workflow logs

The entire pipeline is idempotent, meaning you can run it repeatedly without issues, and it's intelligent enough to create resources only when needed while updating existing ones gracefully.

## 💻 Local Development Setup

Before deploying to AWS, you might want to run and test the application locally. Here's how to get both the frontend and backend running on your development machine:

### Backend Development Server

Navigate to the backend directory and start the Express server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend API will start on `http://localhost:3000`. You'll see colorful console output indicating successful startup, along with the available endpoints. The development server includes hot-reloading through nodemon, so any changes you make to the source files will automatically restart the server.

**Available Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/events` - Retrieves all campus events
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint (returns server status)

### Frontend Development Server

In a separate terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite will start the development server on `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port if 5173 is occupied). The development experience includes:
- **Instant hot module replacement** - See your changes reflected immediately without full page reloads
- **Optimized dependency pre-bundling** - Fast cold start times even with large dependency trees
- **Rich error overlays** - Helpful error messages displayed directly in the browser

The frontend is pre-configured to proxy API requests to `http://localhost:3000`, so everything works seamlessly in development mode just as it would in production.

### Development Tips

- **Parallel Terminal Windows**: Keep both servers running in separate terminal windows for the best development experience
- **Browser DevTools**: Use React DevTools extension to inspect component state and props
- **API Testing**: Use tools like Postman or curl to test backend endpoints independently
- **Tailwind IntelliSense**: Install the official Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension in VS Code for class name autocompletion

## 📋 Detailed Deployment Workflow Breakdown

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Deployment Taking Too Long / Services Won't Stabilize

**Symptoms:** GitHub Actions workflow gets stuck at "Waiting for services to stabilize..." for more than 5 minutes.

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **ECR Connection Issues**
   - **Error:** `ResourceInitializationError: unable to pull secrets or registry auth`
   - **Cause:** Tasks can't reach Amazon ECR to pull Docker images
   - **Solution:** Verify security groups allow outbound traffic (they should by default). Run cleanup and redeploy:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/cleanup.sh
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Health Check Failures**
   - **Error:** Tasks keep restarting, never become healthy
   - **Cause:** Application not responding on correct port or health check path
   - **Solution:** 
     - Verify backend responds at `/health` endpoint
     - Check CloudWatch Logs for application errors
     - Ensure container port matches task definition (3000 for backend, 80 for frontend)

3. **Insufficient Resources**
   - **Cause:** Tasks fail due to memory/CPU limits
   - **Solution:** Check task stopped reason in ECS console, increase CPU/memory in task definitions if needed

### Checking Deployment Status

View detailed logs in AWS Console:

```bash
# Check ECS Service Events
aws ecs describe-services --cluster campus-events-cluster \
  --services campus-events-backend campus-events-frontend \
  --query 'services[*].events[0:5]'

# Check Task Status
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster campus-events-cluster \
  --service-name campus-events-backend

# View Container Logs (replace TASK_ID)
aws logs tail /ecs/campus-events-backend --follow
```

### Target Groups Show Unhealthy

**Check target health:**
```bash
aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
  --target-group-arn <your-target-group-arn>
```

**Common issues:**
- Security groups blocking ALB → container traffic
- Application not listening on 0.0.0.0 (listening on localhost only)
- Wrong health check path configured

### Application Not Accessible via ALB

**Wait Time:** Allow 1-2 minutes after deployment for DNS propagation and health checks to pass.

**Verify ALB is working:**
```bash
# Get ALB DNS
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers \
  --names campus-events-alb \
  --query 'LoadBalancers[0].DNSName' --output text

# Test health endpoint
curl http://<alb-dns>:3000/health
```

### Clean Slate Approach

If deployment continues to fail, the safest approach is to clean up all resources and start fresh:

```bash
# Run cleanup
./scripts/cleanup.sh

# Wait 2-3 minutes for deletion to complete

# Trigger fresh deployment
git push origin main
```

This ensures no misconfigured resources are interfering with the deployment.
